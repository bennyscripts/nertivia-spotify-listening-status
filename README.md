# nertivia-spotify-listening-status
A script that takes what you're listening too on Spotify and sets it as your Nertivia custom status.

### setup
- Install requirements : `pip install -r requirements.txt`
- Get your spotify token from https://spotify-token.ilybenny.repl.co/
- Get your nertivia token from `hauthid` local storage key
- Set both values in `config.json`
- Run `main.py`

### info
If you get `Error getting playback` message being printed very fast, just grab your spotify token again and set it in the config.
